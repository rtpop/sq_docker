# SQ meetings - CI and Docker workshop (01/04/2022)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or newer
- Docker
- git
- A GitHub account (required for the CI part)
- A text editor
- Apptainer/Singularity (optional)
- pipeviewer (pv, optional)

The code in this repository was developed on a Linux machine and should run fine on macOS.
The code should in principle run on Windows. Nevertheless, a laptop with a UNIX-like os is highly recommended.

Singularity has recently been renamed to Apptainer. First try to install Apptainer and fall back on Singularity if Apptainer is not available for your OS/distribution.

### Installing Docker

If you are running a Linux distribution you can most likely install `Docker` through your system package manager (Ã¨.g. `apt`, `dnf`, `pacman`...).

In case your distribution does not package `Docker`, you can try to follow [these](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#other-linux-distributions) instructions.

On macOS the instructions vary sligthly depending on whether you device has an Apple Silicon (M1) CPU:
- Instructions for macOS w/ Intel CPUs - [link](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/#mac-with-intel-chip)
- Instructions for macOS w/ Apple Silicon - [link](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/#mac-with-apple-silicon)

Here are the instructions for Windows in case you don't have access to a laptop with Linux/macOS: [link](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)
If you are running macOS

### Installing Apptainer/Singularity
Apptainer/Singularity can only run on Linux. If you are using macOS or Windows feel free to skip this section.

Many Linux distributions have a package for Apptainer/Singularity.

In case yours doesn't, you can follow [these](https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/blob/main/INSTALL.md) instructions to install Apptainer from source.

### Testing Docker and Apptainer/Singularity

Testing Docker:
```bash
sudo docker run ubuntu:20.04 cat /etc/os-release
```
Testing Apptainer/Singularity:
```bash
singularity exec docker://ubuntu:20.04 cat /etc/os-release
```

Both commands should produce an output like the following:
```
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION="20.04.4 LTS (Focal Fossa)"
ID=ubuntu
ID_LIKE=debian
PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS"
VERSION_ID="20.04"
HOME_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/"

VERSION_CODENAME=focal
UBUNTU_CODENAME=focal
```

<summary>In case you host machine is running Ubuntu 20.04</summary>

If your host machine is running Ubuntu 20.04, you can try to run the above commands with `fedora:36` instead of `ubuntu:20.04`
In this case the output should looke like this:

```
NAME="Fedora Linux"
VERSION="36 (Container Image Prerelease)"
ID=fedora
